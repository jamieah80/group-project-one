Investigating the trope of “Oscar Bait”

“Oscar Bait” is a well-known term in the movie and movie journalism industry, describing the perceived phenomenon of better movies being released shortly before the Academy Awards nominations voting window opens in January each year.
We are looking to investigate:
-	Are movies released within two months of the Academy Awards Nominations window more likely to be nominated for an award?
(Histogram – release month against no. of nominations/wins)
(Line plot – two lines, year against no. of nominations, line 1 for October – December, line 2 for January – September)
-	Do movie review scores accurately reflect how a movie will perform at the Academy Awards?
(Box plot of a sample of movie review scores through the year, Oscar nominees will be added on in a different colour.)
-	Do movies released within two months of the Academy Awards Nominations window receive higher review scores than movies released outside of that window?
(Scatter Plot – release date against review score)
(Pie Chart – Nominees released within two months of awards vs other nominees)
Together, these questions would illustrate whether “Oscar Bait” actually exists, and whether movie reviews align with Academy Awards results. If we find that movies released later in the year have greater review scores but do not win awards as frequently, this may suggest that the idea of “Oscar Bait” influences journalists when reviewing movies throughout the year.

We will utilise themoviedb.org  API to collect review scores and release dates, and cross reference with the database of winners and nominees found on AminFadaee/Academy-Awards-Data: Data for Academy Awards (github.com).
